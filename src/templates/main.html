        <P>Our study clusters MPs by the similarity of their voting patterns: if two MPs always vote the same way, the chart groups them tightly together.</P>
        <p>The patterns on key Brexit votes reveal the emergence of four cross-party political factions that are wrangling for control of the negotiations.</p>
        <p>A cross-party group of pro-European MPs usually votes with each other, with or against their own frontbenches, while Europhobe Conservatives now constitute a party within the party.</p>
